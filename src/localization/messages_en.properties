info_text=In Århus Caf\u00E9 Church we have a cozy atmosphere where everyone is welcome. During a normal week, we worship on Saturday afternoon and keep the caf\u00E9 open Wednesday evening. For more information on dates check our calendar which can be viewed from the main page. Typically, there is something planned Wednesday evening. Bible study, gamenight or movie night. Saturdays, our own pastor, Robert Fisher, or possibly a guest speaker conduct the church service. For worship we are led in praise by people from our music team. The worship is a good mix of different songs, old and modern, cross-genre.
